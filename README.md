##Use

This utility reads in a list of names from a source file and can then generate names similar to that source list.

To use, select a .txt file to use as a source file. The file should be formatted to have each name separated by whitespace.

To generate a list of names, enter the number of names you want and click 'generate'. The program will only output unique names generated, so you may not get as many names out as you asked for depending on how robust your input is.

To save the list of generated names, enter a name for your output file and the program will save all generated names to the file.

The program defaults to only recognizing english alphabetic characters and will simply ignore any unrecognized character. You can add or remove characters by simply typing them into the prompt. You man add or remove more than one character at once.
